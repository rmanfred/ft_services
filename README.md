# Ft_services

Ft_services will introduce you to Kubernetes. You will discover cluster management and
deployment with Kubernetes. You will virtualize a network and do "clustering".

## Common instructions

- You must put all the necessary files for the configuration of your server in a folder
called srcs.

- Your setup.sh file should be at the root of your repository. This script will setup
all your applications.

- This subject requires both old and new practices. We therefore advise you not to
be afraid to read a lot of documentation about Docker, Kubernetes, and all other
things useful for the project.

## Mandatory part

- Each service will have to run in a dedicated container.

- Services: Nginx, Wordpress, PhpMyAdmin, Ftps, Grafana, MySQL, InfluxDB, Telegraf
